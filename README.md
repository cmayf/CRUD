IMDB Database Catalog

This project makes use of the "title.basics.tsv" data file from https://datasets.imdbws.com/
I provided a script that downloads and unzips the file.

Navigate to the \src folder and type "./getDataFile.sh"

The file in the folder should be named "data.tsv"

Type "make clean" to remove the existing .o files. 
Compile with "make". Run with "./main".
